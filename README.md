# ColdFusion 8 Syntax Dictionary for CFEclipse

This XML contains most (if I missed something please fork and add it) of the ColdFusion 8 tags and functions so that CFEclipse will have code hiniting.

Obviously this is an on going project as with the release of 8.01 we need to update.

# TO INSTALL

1. You must have CFEclipse installed. If not: go get it at http://www.cfeclipse.org/
2. Download and save the xml file into your CFEclipse dictionary folder. This is normally located in <eclipse install folder>\org.cfeclipse.cfml_<version number>\dictionary.
3. Restart Eclipse with the *-clean* option.
